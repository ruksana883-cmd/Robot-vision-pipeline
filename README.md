# Robot-vision-pipeline
A Python project using OpenCV to simulate robot vision. Detects edges, contours, and object centroids, visualizes obstacles, and demonstrates how robots perceive their environment for navigation, object tracking, and manipulation tasks.
# Robot Vision Pipeline

A simple robot vision simulation using OpenCV. This project demonstrates:
- Edge detection (Canny) for obstacles
- Contour detection for object shapes
- Centroid calculation for object localization
- Overlay of edges for visualization

## Installation
